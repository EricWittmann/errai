[Running the examples]

The examples come with a prebuild maven setup. In order to run them
you need to execute the following command within an example directory:

    mvn gwt:run

This will lauch the GWT hosted mode which allows you to access the
application using any web browser available on your system.

Alternatively you can import the example in your IDE
(simply import the maven structure) and launch them using your IDE GWT plugin.
