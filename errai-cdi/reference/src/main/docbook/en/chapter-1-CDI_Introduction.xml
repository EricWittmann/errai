    <title>CDI Introduction</title>
    <para>CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) is the Jave EE standard (JSR-299) for handling dependency injection. In addition to dependency injection, the standard encompasses component lifecycle, application configuration, call-interception and a decoupled, type-safe eventing specification.</para>
    <para>The Errai CDI extension implements a subset of the specification for use inside of client-side applications within Errai, as well as additional capabilities such as distributed eventing.</para>
    <para>Errai CDI does not currently implement all life cycles specified in JSR-299 or interceptors. These deficiencies may be addressed in future versions.</para>
    <important>
      <para>The Errai CDI extension itself is implemented on top of the Errai IOC Framework, which itself implements the JSR-330 specification. Inclusion of the CDI module your GWT project will result in the extensions automatically being loaded and made available to your application.</para>
